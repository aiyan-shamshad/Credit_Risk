## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict the **creditworthiness** of individuals based on various financial and personal attributes using the **German Credit Dataset**. The primary goal is to build a reliable machine learning pipeline using the **Random Forest Ensemble Method** that can classify whether a person is a **good (1)** or **bad (2)** credit risk.
